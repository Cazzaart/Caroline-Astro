## Basic Configuration

1. Update the astro.config.mjs file to include your correct site url.
2. Update the consts.ts file to include the correct site title and description.
3. Update the footer copyright text, and the social links in the SiteFooter component, eg:

```html
<a href="### Your Instagram Link Here">
```

```html
<p class="copyright-notice">
  &copy; {today.getFullYear()} Your Name
</p
```

## Content / Design Guidelines

- Keep your featured images in the same dimensions.
- Ideally provide your images at either 1800px width or 2400px for maximum quality
- Use svg images if suitable, but if you use an svg for the featured image, include a version in a standard image format (e.g. .jpg / .webp / .png) for the 'OpenGraphImage' - optionally defined the post frontmatter.

Otherwise please review the preceding posts for additional information and guidelines for working with the Astro Sky theme.
