## Basic Configuration

1. Update the astro.config.mjs file to include your correct site url.

```mjs
import { defineConfig } from "astro/config";
import mdx from "@astrojs/mdx";
import sitemap from "@astrojs/sitemap";

export default defineConfig({
  site: "https://astro-sky.vercel.app",
  integrations: [mdx(), sitemap()],
  build: {
    assets: "assets",
  },
});
```

2. Update the consts.ts file (in the src directory) to include the correct site title and description.

```ts
export const SITE_TITLE = "Astro Sky";
export const SITE_DESCRIPTION =
  "Welcome to Astro Sky. A minimal and elegant portfolio theme built for Astro.";
```

3. Update the footer copyright text, and the social links in the SiteFooter component, eg:

```html
<a href="### Your Instagram Link Here">
```

```html
<p class="copyright-notice">
  &copy; {today.getFullYear()} Your Name
</p
```

## Content / Design Guidelines

- Keep your featured images in the same dimensions.
- Ideally provide your images at either 1800px width or 2400px for maximum quality
- Use svg images if suitable, but if you use an svg for the featured image, include a version in a standard image format (e.g. .jpg / .webp / .png) for the 'OpenGraphImage' - optionally defined the post frontmatter.

Otherwise please review the preceding posts for additional information and guidelines for working with the Astro Sky theme.
