Hi. This is an example post written in Markdown. It is designed to outline how to create content for the Astro Sky theme, and also to show you how post like this look under the hood.

## What is Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight markup language for formatting text. It uses plain text syntax to create headings, lists, links, and more, which can be easily converted to HTML. It's used because it's simple, readable, and versatile, making it ideal for writing content for the web. Please review this handy guide for [Markdown syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/).

## What is MDX

MDX is a special flavor of Markdown that supports embedded JavaScript & JSX syntax. This unlocks the ability to [mix JavaScript and UI Components into your Markdown content](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/markdown-content/#mdx-features) for things like interactive charts or alerts.

This theme uses MDX to incorporate a few fancy components, including.

- A custom built image component that will serve different sizes of your images at different screen sizes, which is great for website optimisation.
- A custom built component for embedding Youtube videos.

Otherwise please review the preceding posts for more info.
