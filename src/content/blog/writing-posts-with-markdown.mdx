Hi. This is an example post written in Markdown. It is designed to outline how to create content for the Astro Sky theme, and more importantly, to show you how a post like this looks under the hood. (That is if you have access to the theme files ðŸ˜‰)

## What is Markdown?

Markdown is a lightweight markup language for formatting text. It uses plain text syntax to create headings, lists, links, and more, which can be easily converted to HTML. It's used because it's simple, readable, and versatile, making it ideal for writing content for the web. Please review this handy guide for [Markdown syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/).

## What is MDX?

MDX is a special flavor of Markdown that supports embedded JavaScript & JSX syntax. Please see [this article](https://mdxjs.com/docs/what-is-mdx/) for a thorough explanation of MDX and how it is used.

## How this theme uses MDX...

For this theme, MDX is used as the format for the site content such as the posts and projects.

Specifically this theme uses MDX to best accommdate for a few custom components that handle things like images and other embedded content.

Otherwise please review the preceding posts for additional information and guidelines for working with the Astro Sky theme.
