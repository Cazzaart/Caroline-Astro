This page includes an example image as an SVG file. The same svg image is used for the featured image (on the home and projects pages). Generally, if the images are svg in nature this will speed up the site a load whilst improving the quality of the images.

In the post front matter however, an alternate version of the image is provided in webp format which is used for the posts open graph image (which currently don't support svg images).
