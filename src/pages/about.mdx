Astro Sky is an elegant and streamlined portfolio theme specifically designed and built for artists and designers. Astro Sky seeks to find a balance between ticking all the standard auditing boxes whilst keeping the theme code as simple and as straightforward as possible.

Specifically the Astro Sky theme aims to:

-   Achieve a perfect Chrome Lighthouse score for performance, accessibility, SEO, and best practices.

-   Optimise all images correctly, including featured images and open graph images etc.

-   Optimise image src sets for different layout sizes.

-   Provide a general portfolio theme that looks nice.

-   Provide an alternative portfolio website to those offered by frameworks such as Wordpress, Squarespace, and Wix etc.

## Todo List

When I get the time I would like to add the following functionality:

-   Include a mobile menu so the main menu can accomadate more menu items.

-   Include a system to customise the social media menu.

-   Include a system to easily generate different portfolio categories.
